//
// With the launcher present, every variant execs it. Without it, `pre` denies when a preset sits at
// or above one of the candidate directories; `stop` and `session-start` exit 0. agy runs hooks from
// its plugin folder and sets no project variable, so its only candidate is workspacePaths[0] from
// the payload, and a payload that names workspacePaths but yields no path denies. `${d%/*}` walks up
// without forking `dirname`, and only an absolute path enters the loop: a relative one never ends.
