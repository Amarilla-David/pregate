# core pack reference

Generated from the current CLI and source manifests by `bun scripts/docs-reference.ts`. Do not edit this section by hand.

Version: `0.0.1`. Category: **invariants**.

These are manifest defaults. All core rules activate automatically and enforce unless explicitly disabled in the reviewed preset. Optional packs activate only when selected. `pregate preset show` gives the effective contract. A manifest's `complete` label refers to that manifest, not full library or methodology compliance.

## core/pregate-integrity

Manifest version: `1.1.0`. Status: **complete**.

### core/EVA-GEN-001

Check: [`core/integrity/new-generated-marker@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/integrity/new-generated-marker/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `diff`. Phases: `pre`, `stop`.

Languages: language-independent change guard. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `integrity.generated-marker`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

A generated marker makes reviewers and tools skip the file and freezes it against later edits.

Default parameters: `{"markers":["@generatedMarkers"]}`.

**Repair:** Remove the marker; if the file really comes from a generator, run the generator and ask the user to commit its output.

**Scope and limits:** Actual line or block comments carry generated markers in supported source. Strings, templates, regular expressions, JSX text and JSON data do not. Markdown counts genuine HTML comments outside fenced, indented and matched backtick code; prose and examples do not exempt a file. Unsupported executable source retains conservative substring matching. Invalid parsed source cannot hide a marker through syntax recovery.

Check-specific parameter schema (this check also accepts `paths`, `exclude` and intersecting `within` globs):

```json
{
  "markers": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

Source metadata:

```json
{
  "work": "PREGATE anti-evasion policy",
  "locator": "SPEC §10.1 (self-exemption) and DD-21",
  "paraphrase": "Marking hand-written code as generated exempts it from review and from later edits; only a generator may introduce the marker."
}
```

### core/EVA-GEN-002

Check: [`core/integrity/edit-generated-or-excluded@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/integrity/edit-generated-or-excluded/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `placement`. Phases: `pre`, `stop`.

Languages: language-independent change guard. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `integrity.generated-edit`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Edits to generated or excluded files skip every rule and are lost or overwritten at the next regeneration.

Default parameters: `{}`.

**Repair:** Change the source the file is generated from, or ask the user to bring the file into scope in the preset.

**Scope and limits:** Deleting a genuine comment marker in the same edit, or moving code to an excluded path, does not bypass placement. Generated-marker detection uses the same comment and documentation semantics as EVA-GEN-001. Unsupported executable source retains conservative substring matching; unsupported language coverage remains incomplete.

Check-specific parameter schema (this check also accepts `paths`, `exclude` and intersecting `within` globs):

```json
{}
```

Source metadata:

```json
{
  "work": "PREGATE anti-evasion policy",
  "locator": "SPEC §8.5.10 and DD-21",
  "paraphrase": "Files that were generated or excluded before the session are regenerated or changed by people, never edited by the agent, because no rule evaluates them."
}
```

### core/EVA-SUP-001

Check: [`core/integrity/new-inline-suppression@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/integrity/new-inline-suppression/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `diff`. Phases: `pre`, `stop`.

Languages: language-independent change guard. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `integrity.suppression`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Each new suppression silences a check exactly where it found a problem.

Default parameters: `{"markers":["pregate-disable","eslint-disable","@ts-ignore","@ts-nocheck","@ts-expect-error","biome-ignore","oxlint-disable","deno-lint-ignore"]}`.

**Repair:** Fix the reported problem; if the rule is wrong here, write a request under .pregate/requests/ proposing an override and tell the user.

**Scope and limits:** File-wide block comments and swapping one suppression for another tool's syntax remain checked. Supported source counts comment tokens, not strings, JSX text, templates, regular expressions or documentation examples. This counts marker occurrences in comments; it does not implement each linter's directive grammar. Unsupported executable source and invalid recovered trees retain conservative substring matching.

Check-specific parameter schema (this check also accepts `paths`, `exclude` and intersecting `within` globs):

```json
{
  "markers": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

Source metadata:

```json
{
  "work": "PREGATE anti-evasion policy",
  "locator": "SPEC §10.1 (inline suppression)",
  "paraphrase": "An inline suppression turns a check off at the exact spot where it found a problem; suppressions are a human decision, so the agent does not add new ones."
}
```

### core/EVA-SCOPE-001

Check: [`core/integrity/out-of-scope-file@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/integrity/out-of-scope-file/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `placement`. Phases: `pre`, `stop`.

Languages: language-independent change guard. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `integrity.scope`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Code outside the evaluated scope is code no invariant protects.

Default parameters: `{"extensions":["","py","pyi","go","rs","java","kt","kts","groovy","scala","clj","cljs","rb","php","cs","swift","ex","exs","erl","dart","lua","pl","r","c","h","cc","cpp","hpp","sql","sh","bash","zsh","fish","ps1","astro"]}`.

**Repair:** Write the code in an in-scope file of a supported language; if that path or language is required, ask the user to change the preset.

**Scope and limits:** Other excluded folders, other programming languages (also with the extension in capitals), or files without an extension inside a layer.

Check-specific parameter schema (this check also accepts `paths`, `exclude` and intersecting `within` globs):

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^[a-z0-9]*$"
    }
  }
}
```

Source metadata:

```json
{
  "work": "PREGATE anti-evasion policy",
  "locator": "SPEC §8.5.10-11",
  "paraphrase": "New code goes where the rules apply; a new file in an excluded path, or a file in a language without analysis inside a layer, escapes every check."
}
```

## core/software-invariants

Manifest version: `1.1.0`. Status: **preview**.

### core/CORE-INV-001

Check: [`core/invariants/reason-for-change@1.0.0`](../catalog/checks/invariants/reason-for-change/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r001`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Divide the system by the reason for change, not by the technology. Put in one module the parts that change together for the same reason. Do not mix display logic, decision logic, and storage logic in one module.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-001"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-001 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls. Review the binding as a contract change, then run pregate fitness run CORE-INV-001. Repair a failed verification. For dated runtime, vulnerability or operational facts, review an explicit maxAgeMs and inspect current authoritative evidence. A human can explicitly disable the requirement if it does not apply.

**Scope and limits:** A passing unrelated test, stale receipts, silence or a syntax-only approximation do not prove the full requirement. Verification is bounded by the human-reviewed command and rationale; inspect what it tests. Missing verification is unverified, not compliant. Packs never supply executable fitness commands.

Check-specific parameter schema (project fitness cannot be narrowed with per-file `paths`, `exclude` or `within`):

```json
{
  "verifier": {
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "\\S"
  }
}
```

Source metadata:

```

### core/CORE-INV-002

Check: [`core/invariants/cohesion-and-coupling@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/invariants/cohesion-and-coupling/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r002`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Keep related parts together. Keep unrelated parts separate. A dependency must be as small as possible. A module must not know the internal parts of another module. A change in one module does not force a change in an unrelated module.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-002"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-002 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls. Review the binding as a contract change, then run pregate fitness run CORE-INV-002. Repair a failed verification. For dated runtime, vulnerability or operational facts, review an explicit maxAgeMs and inspect current authoritative evidence. A human can explicitly disable the requirement if it does not apply.

**Scope and limits:** A passing unrelated test, stale receipts, silence or a syntax-only approximation do not prove the full requirement.

### core/CORE-INV-003

Check: [`core/invariants/information-hiding@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/invariants/information-hiding/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r003`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Hide the parts that can change. The public contract must be stable. The representation, the algorithm, the storage, and the supplier must be private. A caller must depend only on the contract. Modules talk only through a stable interface. The product does not expose an internal type on a public boundary. A contract at a boundary is written and current. A public interface has current documentation.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-003"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-003 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls. Review the binding as a contract change, then run pregate fitness run CORE-INV-003. Repair a failed verification.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r004`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Each observable behavior becomes a contract. For this reason, keep each contract small.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-004"}`.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r005`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Dependencies must point to the stable part. Code that changes frequently must not be a dependency of code that changes rarely. A concrete part that changes must depend on a stable abstraction. Do not do the opposite.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-005"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-005 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r007`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Give each unit one reason for change. This rule applies to a function, a module, a process, and a service. If two different forces change the same unit, divide the unit. Each module has one responsibility. A function does one job.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-007"}`.

Check: [`core/invariants/domain-validation@1.0.0`](../catalog/checks/invariants/domain-validation/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r013`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Boundary validation can repeat a domain rule. The domain must not depend on the boundary. The domain must keep its own rules.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-013"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-013 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls. Review the binding as a contract change, then run pregate fitness run CORE-INV-013. Repair a failed verification. For dated runtime, vulnerability or operational facts, review an explicit maxAgeMs and inspect current authoritative evidence. A human can explicitly disable the requirement if it does not apply.

**Scope and limits:** A passing unrelated test, stale receipts, silence or a syntax-only approximation do not prove the full requirement. Verification is bounded by the human-reviewed command and rationale; inspect what it tests. Missing verification is unverified, not compliant. Packs never supply executable fitness commands.

### core/CORE-INV-028

Check: [`core/invariants/replaceable-modules@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/invariants/replaceable-modules/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r028`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Design each module so that you can delete it. A replaceable module has a small contract, one owner, and no caller that knows its internal parts. Code that you cannot delete is a cost of change. An external service sits behind an interface. The product can replace that service without a rewrite of the domain.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-028"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-028 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls. Review the binding as a contract change, then run pregate fitness run CORE-INV-028. Repair a failed verification. For dated runtime, vulnerability or operational facts, review an explicit maxAgeMs and inspect current authoritative evidence. A human can explicitly disable the requirement if it does not apply.

**Scope and limits:** A passing unrelated test, stale receipts, silence or a syntax-only approximation do not prove the full requirement. Verification is bounded by the human-reviewed command and rationale; inspect what it tests. Missing verification is unverified, not compliant. Packs never supply executable fitness commands.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r031`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Make compatibility an explicit decision. If you do not control the consumers of a contract, version the contract or add fields. Do not break the contract. If you control all consumers, change and migrate them together. Two truths cost more. An externally consumed public contract must have an explicit version; controlled consumers can migrate together under the original compatibility rule. An incompatible change to an externally consumed public contract must increment its version. An externally consumed public contract must have a written deprecation policy with scope, notice and support windows. The previous externally consumed public version must remain supported throughout its stated deprecation window.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-031"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-031 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls.

### core/CORE-INV-043

Check: [`core/invariants/boundary-observability@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/invariants/boundary-observability/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r043`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

If you cannot observe a behavior, you cannot operate it. Each relevant boundary must emit the data that answers these questions: what occurred, to whom, with which result, and in which time. Emit a correlation identity, the decision, and the error class. A log of all data is not observation. It is noise. A failure writes a structured log. The product measures latency, errors, and saturation.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-043"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-043 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls. Review the binding as a contract change, then run pregate fitness run CORE-INV-043. Repair a failed verification. For dated runtime, vulnerability or operational facts, review an explicit maxAgeMs and inspect current authoritative evidence. A human can explicitly disable the requirement if it does not apply.

**Scope and limits:** A passing unrelated test, stale receipts, silence or a syntax-only approximation do not prove the full requirement. Verification is bounded by the human-reviewed command and rationale; inspect what it tests. Missing verification is unverified, not compliant. Packs never supply executable fitness commands.

Check-specific parameter schema (project fitness cannot be narrowed with per-file `paths`, `exclude` or `within`):

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r047`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Put cost in a budget, not in a hope. CPU, memory, connections, payload size, and query cardinality must have an explicit limit. An unbounded query is a capacity incident that waits for traffic.

Check: [`core/invariants/automated-deployment@1.1.0`](../catalog/checks/invariants/automated-deployment/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `invariant.r059`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

A deployment is automated.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"CORE-INV-059"}`.

**Repair:** Bind CORE-INV-059 to a project fitness function that tests every applicable condition in this requirement and documents its coverage and invalid controls. Review the binding as a contract change, then run pregate fitness run CORE-INV-059. Repair a failed verification. For dated runtime, vulnerability or operational facts, review an explicit maxAgeMs and inspect current authoritative evidence. A human can explicitly disable the requirement if it does not apply.

**Scope and limits:** A passing unrelated test, stale receipts, silence or a syntax-only approximation do not prove the full requirement. Verification is bounded by the human-reviewed command and rationale; inspect what it tests. Missing verification is unverified, not compliant. Packs never supply executable fitness commands.

Check-specific parameter schema (project fitness cannot be narrowed with per-file `paths`, `exclude` or `within`):

  "verifier": {
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "\\S"
