# enterprise-ready pack reference

Generated from the current CLI and source manifests by `bun scripts/docs-reference.ts`. Do not edit this section by hand.

Version: `1.0.0`. Category: **invariants**.

These are manifest defaults. All core rules activate automatically and enforce unless explicitly disabled in the reviewed preset. Optional packs activate only when selected. `pregate preset show` gives the effective contract. A manifest's `complete` label refers to that manifest, not full library or methodology compliance.

### enterprise-ready/ENTERPRISE-001

Check: [`enterprise-ready/identity/requirement-001@1.0.0`](checks/identity/requirement-001/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `enterprise-ready.r001`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

The product supports single sign-on with SAML 2.0.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"ENTERPRISE-001"}`.

**Repair:** Bind ENTERPRISE-001 to a human-reviewed product assertion with scope, applicability, owner, evidence source and freshness controls in its rationale. Include a failing control. Run pregate fitness run ENTERPRISE-001; repair failed assertions. Review conditional applicability instead of returning an unexplained pass.

**Scope and limits:** This is a project evidence gate, not a syntax detector or readiness certification. A receipt proves only the reviewed assertion ran on the current inputs. External legal, certification, deployment and performance evidence needs its own authenticity, scope and freshness checks inside that assertion. Missing evidence remains unverified. Pack fixtures test receipt admission, not the product requirement. Packs never supply executable commands.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `enterprise-ready.r019`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Each audit record contains the actor, the action, the target, and the time.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"ENTERPRISE-019"}`.

**Repair:** Bind ENTERPRISE-019 to a human-reviewed product assertion with scope, applicability, owner, evidence source and freshness controls in its rationale. Include a failing control. Run pregate fitness run ENTERPRISE-019; repair failed assertions. Review conditional applicability instead of returning an unexplained pass.

**Scope and limits:** This is a project evidence gate, not a syntax detector or readiness certification. A receipt proves only the reviewed assertion ran on the current inputs. External legal, certification, deployment and performance evidence needs its own authenticity, scope and freshness checks inside that assertion. Missing evidence remains unverified. Pack fixtures test receipt admission, not the product requirement. Packs never supply executable commands.

Run pregate fitness run ENTERPRISE-055; repair failed assertions. Review conditional applicability instead of returning an unexplained pass.

**Scope and limits:** This is a project evidence gate, not a syntax detector or readiness certification. A receipt proves only the reviewed assertion ran on the current inputs. External legal, certification, deployment and performance evidence needs its own authenticity, scope and freshness checks inside that assertion. Missing evidence remains unverified. Pack fixtures test receipt admission, not the product requirement. Packs never supply executable commands.

Check-specific parameter schema (project fitness cannot be narrowed with per-file `paths`, `exclude` or `within`):
