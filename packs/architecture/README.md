# architecture

Optional policies for declared dependency graphs and architecture boundaries. This pack owns layer direction, prohibited packages in core layers, and the use-case API constraint. It also checks path segments and declaration shapes: a domain file that names an adapter, a query that writes, a slice that reaches into a sibling's internals, a port module that grows an implementation, an anti-corruption module that re-exports a foreign type, and a repository that returns the raw row.

`architecture/functional-core-imperative-shell` combines `FCIS-DEP-001` (permitted local dependency edges), `FCIS-IO-001` (prohibited I/O imports) and `FCIS-IO-002` (ambient clock, randomness and environment). Declare core, shell and any narrow data/port boundaries in `layers`; the graph check follows literal imports, type imports, path aliases and re-export chains. It does not infer ownership or prove the purity of arbitrary collaborators. This optional pattern pack is separate from the language-independent builtin core.

## User control

The contract is the repository preset, not this pack. Take every pack, some packs, or some rules:

- Omit a pack by leaving it out of `sources`.
- Omit a methodology by leaving it out of `methodologies`.
- Turn one rule down or off with `overrides` (`off`, `warn`, `ask`, or `deny`). The key is `architecture/HEX-EDGE-001`.
- When two methodologies disagree on one dimension, pick a side in `resolve`.
- `enforcement: "shadow"` sets the preset default. An override's `enforcement` selects `shadow` or `enforce` for one alias or check. Integrity always enforces. See [preset examples](../presets/README.md).

Ready-made combinations live in `packs/presets/`.

## Rules

| ID | Forbids | Why | Default severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HEX-EDGE-001` | An import, re-export, or dynamic import whose path enters adapters, infra, or frameworks from domain or application. | A domain or application module that names an adapter compiles only when that adapter is present, so the policy can no longer be tested or reused on its own. | deny |
| `HEX-PORT-001` | A class, abstract class, function, or arrow function declared under ports/. | An implementation in the port folder pulls a concrete dependency into the boundary the domain is allowed to import. | deny |
| `CQRS-QRY-001` | A call that saves, inserts, updates, deletes, or upserts through db, prisma, a repository, or a transaction from a query file. | A query that writes makes the read model a second source of truth and breaks the assumption that repeating the query is safe. | deny |
| `CQRS-CMD-001` | An import, re-export, or dynamic import from a command file into a queries segment. | A command that calls the query stack couples the write to a read model and invites the command to trust a projection it should not update through. | deny |
| `CQRS-QRY-002` | An import, re-export, or dynamic import from a query file into a commands segment. | A query that calls a command changes state on every read, so repeating, caching or retrying it is no longer safe. | deny |
| `SLICE-EDGE-001` | A relative import that enters a sibling feature's internal, persistence, domain, infra, adapters, or application folder. | A slice that uses a neighbor's private folders breaks when that neighbor renames its insides, and the public entry stops being the only contract. | deny |
| `MOD-EDGE-001` | A relative import from one module into another module's internal or persistence folder. | A modular monolith stays one deployable only while modules meet at their public API. Crossing into internals couples two modules' private schemas. | deny |
| `DEP-ENT-001` | An entity file importing use-cases, interface-adapters, frameworks, adapters, or infra. | An entity that names a use case or a framework cannot move to another application without dragging that outer ring along. | deny |
| `DEP-UC-001` | A use-case file importing interface-adapters, frameworks, adapters, or infra. | A use case that names a web framework or a database client can only run where that detail runs. | deny |
| `DEP-IA-001` | An interface-adapters file importing a frameworks or frameworks-and-drivers segment. | An adapter that imports the framework glue can only be built and tested with that glue present. | deny |
| `ACL-REEXPORT-001` | An export from clause whose specifier is a package name rather than a relative path, inside acl/. | Re-exporting the foreign type lets the rest of the system depend on the other model's names, which is the coupling the anti-corruption layer exists to stop. | deny |
| `REPO-ROW-001` | return row, return record, return raw, a cast of those names, or a spread of them, from a repository file. | The row is the database's shape. Returning it makes every caller depend on column names and nullability the domain did not choose. | deny |
| `HEX-ADAPT-001` | An import, re-export, or dynamic import from an input adapter directly into an output adapter. | Input adapters speak to the core through input ports; calling output adapters directly bypasses domain logic and use-case orchestration. | deny |
| `MOD-SHARED-001` | An import, re-export, or dynamic import from shared code into a business module. | The shared kernel must remain free of business domain models and circular dependencies. | deny |
| `LAYER-CLOSE-001` | An import, re-export, or dynamic import from presentation code into persistence. | In strict closed layers, presentation calls business or application logic, never persistence or the database directly. | deny |
| `LAYER-TX-001` | Calling $transaction, beginTransaction, commit, or rollback directly from presentation code. | Transaction demarcation belongs in the application or service layer, not in HTTP controllers or UI presentation. | deny |
| `ARCH-EFF-002` | Calling `crypto.randomUUID()`, `crypto.getRandomValues()`, or `performance.now()` (including `globalThis.*` / `window.*`) inside `domain/`, `entities/`, or `use-cases/`. | Direct Web Crypto randomness and high-resolution timer reads make domain and use-case logic non-deterministic; inject an ID generator or clock port instead. | deny |
