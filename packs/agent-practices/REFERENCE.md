# agent-practices pack reference

Generated from the current CLI and source manifests by `bun scripts/docs-reference.ts`. Do not edit this section by hand.

Version: `1.0.0`. Category: **practice**.

These are manifest defaults. All core rules activate automatically and enforce unless explicitly disabled in the reviewed preset. Optional packs activate only when selected. `pregate preset show` gives the effective contract. A manifest's `complete` label refers to that manifest, not full library or methodology compliance.

### agent-practices/PRACTICE-017

Check: [`agent-practices/behavior-testing/requirement-017@1.0.0`](checks/behavior-testing/requirement-017/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `agent-practices.r017`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Before implementing nontrivial behavior, define its observable acceptance cases and expected failures; use those cases to guide the implementation rather than deriving expectations from the finished code, without forbidding later tests that close a real gap.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"PRACTICE-017"}`.

**Repair:** Bind PRACTICE-017 to a human-reviewed product assertion with scope, applicability, owner, evidence source and freshness controls in its rationale. Include a failing control. Run pregate fitness run PRACTICE-017; repair failed assertions. Review conditional applicability instead of returning an unexplained pass.

**Scope and limits:** This is a project evidence gate, not a syntax detector or readiness certification. A receipt proves only the reviewed assertion ran on the current inputs. External legal, certification, deployment and performance evidence needs its own authenticity, scope and freshness checks inside that assertion. Missing evidence remains unverified. Pack fixtures test receipt admission, not the product requirement. Packs never supply executable commands.

Check-specific parameter schema (project fitness cannot be narrowed with per-file `paths`, `exclude` or `within`):

{
  "verifier": {
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "\\S"

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `agent-practices.r021`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

### agent-practices/PRACTICE-006

Check: [`agent-practices/launch-safety/requirement-006@1.0.0`](checks/launch-safety/requirement-006/check.json). Default severity: **deny**.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `agent-practices.r006`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

When a user-content service relies on a DMCA safe harbor requiring an agent, it must have a reviewed applicability decision, current agent designation and public contact, plus the applicable notice/takedown and repeat-infringer process; registration alone must not be treated as safe-harbor certification.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"PRACTICE-006"}`.

**Repair:** Bind PRACTICE-006 to a human-reviewed product assertion with scope, applicability, owner, evidence source and freshness controls in its rationale. Include a failing control. Run pregate fitness run PRACTICE-006; repair failed assertions. Review conditional applicability instead of returning an unexplained pass.

**Scope and limits:** This is a project evidence gate, not a syntax detector or readiness certification. A receipt proves only the reviewed assertion ran on the current inputs. External legal, certification, deployment and performance evidence needs its own authenticity, scope and freshness checks inside that assertion. Missing evidence remains unverified. Pack fixtures test receipt admission, not the product requirement. Packs never supply executable commands.

Check-specific parameter schema (project fitness cannot be narrowed with per-file `paths`, `exclude` or `within`):

```json
{
  "verifier": {
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "\\S"
  }
}

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `agent-practices.r007`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

A scoped security review must use a threat model tied to the current code and deployment assumptions, identifying protected assets, trust boundaries, entry points and attacker capabilities before prioritizing vulnerability research.

Implementation: `fitness`. Phases: `stop`, `commit`, `ci`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `agent-practices.r008`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Each candidate security finding must be triaged against a reachable code path and explicit exploit preconditions, with evidence, impact and uncertainty reviewed before it is labeled confirmed; failed reproduction alone must not label it a false positive.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `agent-practices.r010`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `agent-practices.r011`. Minimum severity: `deny`.

A security patch must be checked against the original reproducer to show the attack no longer succeeds, with legitimate behavior and relevant regression coverage verified in the same restricted environment before the finding is marked fixed.

Default parameters: `{"verifier":"PRACTICE-011"}`.

Languages: language-independent project verification. Cardinality: `singleton`. Dimension: `agent-practices.r012`. Minimum severity: `deny`.
